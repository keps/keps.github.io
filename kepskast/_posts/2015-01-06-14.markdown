* Owning cats is weird. 
	* Owning other stuff is also weird? 
	* Life is unfair. 
	* The extent to which we have *not* earned our economical priviligue. 
* Thought experiment: Should we own our bodies? 
	* Trafficing and rape are examples of when humans get deprived of their bodies. 
	* Political aspects of owning.
* Petter doesn't get to the point and the others want to slow it down a little. 
	* Pontus owns two bird. 
	* [Free Willy](http://youtu.be/Y6bSTWtAo0U) is a bad idea. 
	* Human values - do birds really care about surviving as individuals? 
* Veganism
	* Plants do not have the right to their plant bodies. 
* Petter keeps trying to get back to the thought experiment and struggles to get to the point. 
	* Should "good-looking" people give away their bodies to "ugly" people for them to also get some great sex? 
	* Why is it so uncomfortable, psychologically speaking, to be deprived of the right to our bodies? 
	* Pontus doesn't get it. 
* Sorry to our listener but we don't have time to write proper show notes for this episode. https://www.facebook.com/petter.rylen/posts/10205577997234237?pnref=story
    * (Sorry again, listener, Petter is acting very entitled.)
* Petter gets to the point at the end. (Disappointment ensues.)
