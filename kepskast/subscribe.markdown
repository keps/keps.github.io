[RSS]({{ site.podcast_feed_url }}), [iTunes]({{ site.iTunes_url }}). There, go and listen.

## For podcast beginners

It is possible to subscribe to Kepskast in several ways:

1. The simplest is to use a podcast app on you smartphone. See suggestions below.
2. If you have an MP3-player, the simplest way is probably to [use iTunes]({{ site.iTunes_url }}).
3. If you think this webpage rocks (thank you!) and want to go here manually all the time (?) ... be our guest?

## Apps

To add Kepskast to your podcast app, first try searching in the app. If you can't find us: copy the adress <{{ site.podcast_feed_url }}> and paste it somewhere suitable in the app.

### iOS (iPhone)

* [Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8) is simple, straightforward and free. In our experience _the_ podcast app for iOS (I even removed the other recommendations).

### Android

* Ridiculously expensive (less than a cup of tea at a café)
    * [Pocket Casts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts) is without doubt the number one podcast app on Android (I haven't tried it).
* Free
    * [AntennaPod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod) seems to be a pretty good podcast app (I have no idea what I'm talking about).
    * [BeyondPod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod) is recommended by our listener Rolf (who knows what he's talking about).
